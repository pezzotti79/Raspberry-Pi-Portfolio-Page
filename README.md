	1.	GPIO Pins (General Purpose Input/Output) – These pins enable the connection of external components such as sensors, LEDs, and other electronic devices.
	2.	CPU (Central Processing Unit) – Acts as the main processor, handling instructions and running applications on the Raspberry Pi.
	3.	RAM (Random Access Memory) – Provides temporary storage for data and ensures smooth operation of running programs.
	4.	MicroSD Card Slot – Houses the microSD card, which functions as the Raspberry Pi’s primary storage and operating system boot drive.
	5.	USB-C Power Port – Connects to a power adapter to supply electricity to the Raspberry Pi.
	6.	Micro HDMI Ports – Transmit video and audio signals to an external display such as a monitor or TV.
	7.	Camera Connector – Allows integration of the Raspberry Pi Camera Module for capturing images, recording videos, or computer vision applications.
	8.	3.5mm Audio Jack – Enables connection to speakers or headphones for audio output.
	9.	Gigabit Ethernet Port – Provides wired network connectivity for fast internet access and local networking.
	10.	USB 3.0 Ports (x2) – High-speed USB ports for connecting external devices like storage drives, keyboards, and mice.
	11.	USB 2.0 Port (x1) – A standard USB port with a lower transfer speed, suitable for basic accessories.

	1.	Speaker – Connects to the Raspberry Pi to produce sound output.
	2.	Color Sensor – The Lego Spike color sensor detects and identifies different colors.
	3.	Temperature Sensor – A low-power device that functions like a thermometer to measure temperature.
	4.	Powered Lego Wheel – A motorized Lego wheel, not part of the kit, but similar to the PiWheel. However, it operates at a slower speed.
	5.	Camera Module – An 8-megapixel camera designed specifically for use with the Raspberry Pi.
	6.	Wii Remote – A standard Wii gaming controller.
	7.	NeoPixel Stick – A strip of LEDs capable of displaying various colors based on user configuration.
	8.	Raspberry Pi Build Hat – Attaches to the 40-pin GPIO to enable additional connections for Raspberry Pi projects.
	9.	Ultrasonic Distance Sensor – Uses ultrasonic waves to measure distance by calculating the time it takes for a wave to bounce off an object and return.
	10.	20-Pin Connector – Provides extra connectivity options for additional components.
